Being mindful of your own thoughts, words and actions is the fundamental skill we are all lacking.  It should be taught in schools and all workplaces especially to professions like the police and those that interact with minorities who are judged on a daily basis.  Mindful training is a foundation to all change. 
Thank you for doing this survey.  Would love to see the final results.  Good luck!","Yes"

-Usage of phrases like ACAB and widespread support of violent rioting only serves to drive the silent majority of moderate Americans away from this potential valuable movement. Most Americans dont hate every police officer and most dont like to see businesses burning and looted. Whether or not these are morally acceptable methods, they are not widely popular outside of the social media bubble. That's not to say this has to be a movement that kowtows to political moderates; it cannot, however, be wholly unpalatable to those who vote in every election because that's where the real change can occur.
-With a dramatic increase in concern about racial issues and interest in movements such as Black Lives Matter often comes a dramatic decrease in concern after a short period of time. I find it likely that many of the people currently participating in social media activism and even in-person protests are simply doing it because it's a current trend, less so because it's something they truly believe in—even if their hearts are in the right place. In order to avoid making this another fad, characteristics and strategies of the successful 1960s Civil Rights Movement should be employed. Inspiring leaders, distinct symbolism, peaceful civil defiance strategies, clear policy ideas, and organization are vital for any movement seeking to create lasting reform. 
-White Privilege is certainly a factor in many facets of life, but I believe that its effects are often overstated and the effects of socioeconomic disparities are often understated. Many of the white vs. black differences in privileges in life can be more accurately ascribed to differences in wealth among America's racial groups—that is what needs to be changed in order to achieve greater equity.
-Most agree that this MLK quote is being taken out of context in its current usage; MLK is not supporting rioting or citing it as an effective means of affecting change. He is saying that it is the default human response to injustice and that those who wish to maintain the moral high ground and act strategically should not participate in rioting.","Yes"

Their interaction with police ppl will be when something bad has happened to them. These people do a lot of good work and don’t really get paid much. Of course there are bad ones - like bad doctors and fraudulent business folks, and garbage folks, and waiters. Unfortunately these incidents involve people’s lives and that’s what takes it to a different level. What would you do with a bad doctor who lets a patient die or a bad embezzling business person. This about racial inequality and unfortunately the looting incidents will be more remembered than Floyd. The blacks are not the first group of ppl in history to be oppressed - and apparently it happens for 100s of years in different countries. Are the Chinese oppressed? The Indians? A black person can be president. 
Our policemen spend 99% of their time defending and protecting and eating some donuts. But this group of bad actors unfortunately defined the rest. Clearly the bad cops had poor intent and judgement. They should be incarcerated. 
But I don’t want the black community to think it’s ok to loot. 
I would prefer a group of ppl that showed up to school, did their homework, got a job, showed up on time , paid their bills and voted. That’s being a good citizen and an American.

I’d like to say that I recognize the anger and motivation towards the riots and I do believe the initial riots in Minnesota were necessary in order to garner national attention. However every city in America is suffering huge losses that they may never recover from. I think it’s especially unproductive to burn down family-owned/small businesses who are supporting the BLM movement. It’s not a productive way of protesting and MLK only said that quote to say he understood the meaning of rioting, he never openly supported it. 
Quick disclaimer: I am against point blank ANYONE who loots in response to the murders regardless of race. I am not from that group of people who hold the opinion that it’s only black people starting the riots. 
Second disclaimer: Also anybody who cares more about the riots than the ongoing police brutality has a completely short sided view of the world and they should not be taken seriously. I also am not of this group of people ","Yes"
